# RadarNetworkProject
This is the code for my final project in my Network Location Theory master's level course.  It involves finding MLD optimal sets for placing radar stations over 4 states: Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.  The first map was created in R, and then Python was used to create the data and clean the results from the optimal solutions found in AMPL.  Analysis plots and dashboards were done by my partner, Mike Izzo, in Power BI.

I am not used to dealing with large data files on Github, and after trying LFS and BFG for a while, I have decided to just ignore them with .gitignore.  The data files can still be generated by the jupyter notebooks.

The jupyter notebooks are actually run in alphabetical order, and note that one jupyter notebook that can help with cleaning the results from the AMPL output is in the RelaxData directory.
